# EXPLORA - Mixed Reality Model Marking Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the Explora project repository! Explora is a Mixed Reality Model Marking Application developed as a senior project. Due to contractual obligations with Mia Technology, the source code cannot be made public. However, you can find detailed information about the project, including a summary, findings, demonstration videos and screenshots, and results in this README file.

## Project Overview

Explora is designed for Microsoft HoloLens 2, a mixed reality device. Its primary objective is to enhance the viewing and interaction with 3D objects by allowing users to mark and annotate them in a mixed reality environment. The application consists of two modes: Admin mode and User mode.

In Admin mode, users can scan QR codes to display 3D models and add markings such as arrows, pins, and text. These markings can be edited, removed, and saved for future reference. In User mode, users can view models with existing markings by scanning the relevant QR code.

**Admin Mode**

In Admin mode, users can:
- Scan QR codes to display specific 3D models.
- Add arrows, pins, and informational text to mark components on the model.
- Modify or remove existing markings.
- Save markings for future reference.

**User Mode**

In User mode, users can:
- Scan QR codes to view associated 3D models.
- View existing markings made in Admin mode.
- Navigate through markers step by step using next and back buttons.
